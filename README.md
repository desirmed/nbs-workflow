# nbs-workflow

This is a guide to implement, technically, most of the scientific concepts developed under the various projects. This repository will cover essential workflows, tools, and data layers to help users understand and apply the methodology effectively to their own regions. We are mostly using cloud computing, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Geemap, LeafMap, etc, for most analysis and complementing with Desktop GIS such as QGIS, ArcGIS Pro when it is necessary.

This repository will be maintained and updated collaboratively on GitHub to ensure that learners, researchers, and practitioners have access to the latest tools, resources, workflows and results.

If you have any questions, feel free to post them in the comment section at the end of every guide page. Note that you will need to sign in to GitHub

A [workflowr][] project.
